This work is done as part of the [CORSA](https://corsa.center/) effort and will eventually be integrated into the [CORSA Dashboard](https://github.com/corsa-center/dashboard)

# Getting started


Quickest way to get started is to navigate to the `code-viz/static` directory under this readme, and run `python[3] http.server 8080`

Then navigate to localhost:8080
There will be a file upload ui, upload the clang tidy metrics file under `code-viz/static` and you should be able to see some stats!
